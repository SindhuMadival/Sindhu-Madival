      <h1>Long Island Tercentenary half dollar</h1>
      <hr/>
      <p>The Long Island Tercentenary half dollar was a commemorative half dollar struck by the<a href="" >United States Bureau of the Mint</a> in 1936. The obverse depicts a male Dutch settler and an Algonquian tribesman, and the reverse shows a Dutch sailing ship. It was designed by Howard Weinman, the son of <a href="">Mercury dime designer Adolph A. Weinman.</a></p>
      
      <p>The Long Island Tercentenary Committee wanted a coin to mark the 300th anniversary of the first European settlement there, at modern <a href="">Flatlands, Brooklyn.</a> The authorizing bill for this passed through Congress without opposition, but was amended in the Senate to add protections against past commemorative coin abuses, such as low mintages or a multiplicity of<a href=""> varieties.</a> On April 13, 1936, the bill became law with the signature of President<a href=""> Franklin D. Roosevelt</a></p>
      <p>The coins were not struck until August of that year, too late for the anniversary celebrations, which had been held in May. The coins were placed on sale to the public, and four-fifths of the 100,000 coins sent to the Tercentenary Committee were sold, a result deemed to be successful given the large issue and a lack of advertising. The remainder was sent back to the <a href="">Philadelphia Mint </a>for redemption and melting. The half dollar catalogues up to the low hundreds of dollars.</p>
